Three-dimensional cloud visualisation of an ensemble of molecules/particles.


## Data

Molecule/particle coordinates are assumed to be stored in a csv file.
Each line corresponds to a different molecul/particle and contains three comma-separated values: its x,y,z coordinates.
The columns corresponding to the coordinates should be labeled `'x [nm]'`, `'y [nm]'`, `'z [nm]'`.
